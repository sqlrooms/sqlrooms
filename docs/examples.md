# Example Applications

All example applications are available in our [Examples Repository](https://github.com/sqlrooms/examples). Here's a list of featured examples:

## Basic examples

### [Getting Started](https://github.com/sqlrooms/examples/tree/main/get-started)

[Github repo](https://github.com/sqlrooms/examples/tree/main/get-started)
| [Open in StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/sqlrooms/examples/tree/main/get-started?embed=1)

<!-- <img src="/media/examples/get-started.webp" alt="SQLRooms get started example" width=450> -->

A minimal Vite application demonstrating the basic usage of SQLRooms. Features include:

- Sets up an app store and a single main panel using SQLRooms' project builder utilities
- Loads a CSV file of California earthquakes as a data source
- Runs a SQL query in the browser (DuckDB WASM) to show summary statistics
- Simple UI with loading, error, and result states

To create a new project from the get-started example run this:

```bash
npx degit sqlrooms/examples/get-started my-new-app/
```
