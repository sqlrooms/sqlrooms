## Get Started in Minutes

Set up a simple room that loads and queries a single data table:

```tsx
const {roomStore, useRoomStore} = createRoomStore((set, get, store) => ({
  ...createRoomShellSlice({
    config: {
      dataSources: [
        {
          type: 'url',
          tableName: 'earthquakes',
          url: 'https://.../earthquakes.parquet',
        },
      ],
    },
  })(set, get, store),
}));

export const MyRoom = () => (
  <RoomShell roomStore={roomStore}>
    <MyComponent />
  </RoomShell>
);

function MyComponent() {
  const isTableReady = useRoomStore((state) =>
    Boolean(state.db.findTableByName('earthquakes')),
  );
  const queryResult = useSql<{maxMagnitude: number}>({
    query: `SELECT max(Magnitude) AS maxMagnitude FROM earthquakes`,
    enabled: isTableReady,
  });
  if (!isTableReady) return 'Loading…';
  const row = queryResult.data?.toArray()[0];
  return `Max earthquake magnitude: ${row?.maxMagnitude}`;
}
```

[Complete example on GitHub →](https://github.com/sqlrooms/examples/tree/main/minimal)

That's it! You've just built an app with a flexible store and UI that can be extended with various analytics, visualization and AI modules — all powered by client-side DuckDB with no backend required.

To create a new project from the minimal example, run:

```sh
npx degit sqlrooms/examples/minimal my-minimal-app/
cd my-minimal-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
